    <h3>PREFACE.</h3>

    <p>The completion of the Twentieth Volume of this Miscellany
    presents us with another cause for self-gratulation, and
    thankful acknowledgement to the reading public. This continued
    and unimpaired success amidst a myriad of new-born aspirants,
    is the best proof of our maintenance of public esteem; and so
    long as our efforts are guided by the same singleness of
    purpose that first directed them we shall hope for a
    continuance of such favour. A multitude of contemporaries "whet
    each other;" "thinking nurseth thinking;" and, in like manner,
    reading nurseth reading, and awakens a spirit of inquiry,
    untiring and exhaustless, among all concerned in pursuit and
    wholesome gratification.</p>

    <p>In a retrospect of the hundreds of competitors who have
    started for the prize of public patronage since our outset, we
    shall not, perhaps, be accused of vanity in placing to our own
    account the first appropriation of such means as may have
    contributed to the partial success of our contemporaries. We
    owe them nothing but good will; for we rather regard things
    poetically than politically, and we are anxious to inform and
    amuse the reader&mdash;not to perplex, by constantly reminding
    him of his uncheery lot in life.</p>

    <p>Ten years' establishment in periodical literature may give
    us a sort of patriarchal feeling towards others; for, with one
    exception THE MIRROR is the oldest weekly journal of the
    metropolis. In this comparatively long career, our best
    energies have been directed to the progressive improvement of
    each department of the work. The plan of embellishment, which
    may be said to have originated with THE MIRROR, has been
    extended and improved, until few subjects are incapable of
    successful illustration in its pages; due regard being paid to
    nicety of execution, as well as attractive design. So much for
    the present, state of our "representative system."</p>

    <p>The selection of materials for each sheet of THE MIRROR has
    been regulated by a desire to extend useful information, and to
    cultivate healthful indications of public taste. In a journal,
    like the present, mainly devoted to the accumulation of facts,
    errors and misstatements are inevitable; but, our own
    diligence, aided by sharp-sighted Correspondents, has, from
    time to time, guided us to accuracy in most cases, and directed
    fruitful inquiry upon matters of no ordinary interest or
    character. Scientific information, really made popular, and of
    ready, practical utility, has uniformly found admission in our
    pages; and, above all, subjects of natural history have
    received especial attention, in graphic
    illustrations&mdash;which part of our plan has been adopted by
    every cheap journal of the last four years; or, from the first
    pictorial description of the Zoological Gardens, before the
    publication of the catalogue by the Society; while it is a
    source of gratification to know that within the above period,
    natural history, from being almost confined to public museums
    and private cabinets, has become the most popular study and
    amusement of the present day.</p>

    <p>Upon the continued cheapness of our little work, we do not
    intend to touch, more than by reference to the enlargement of
    the letter-press as commenced with the present volume. The
    alteration has, we believe, received general approbation; and,
    either with regard to the extent of the letter-press,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiv"
       id="pageiv"></a>[pg iv]</span> or the condensed character of
       its subject-matter, we have still the satisfaction of
       knowing THE MIRROR to continue, as it has often been
       characterized by contemporaries, "the cheapest publication
       of the day." Its other merits we are content to leave to the
       discernment of each reader.</p>

    <p>Our future volume will be conducted upon the plan of its
    predecessors, with such improvements as time and occasion may
    suggest. To one point, economy of space, we promise our best
    consideration; though we may not succeed in rivalling Mr.
    Newberry, who, the good humoured Geoffrey Crayon tells us, was
    the first that ever filled his mind with the idea of a good and
    great man. He published all the picture books of his day; and,
    out of his abundant love for children, he charged "nothing for
    either paper or print, and only a half-penny for the
    binding."<a id="footnotetag1"
       name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>
       Rest unto his soul, say we.</p>

    <p>This lengthened, but we hope not ill-timed reference to our
    whole course of Twenty Volumes has left us but little occasion
    to speak of the present portion, individually; although we
    trust this reference would be somewhat supererogatory, from the
    unusual number of Illustrations, and a copious Index to the
    main subjects, of the volume.</p>

    <p>To conclude. We thank all Correspondents for their
    contributions, and invite their cordial co-operation with our
    ensuing efforts. So now "<i>plaudite! valete!</i>"</p>

    <h3>NOTICES</h3>

    <h4>OF</h4>

    <h2>WASHINGTON IRVING, ESQ.</h2>

    <h3>AND HIS WORKS.</h3>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Washington Irving was born, in the State of New York, in the
    year 1782, and is, consequently, in his fifty-first year. His
    early life cannot better be told than in his own graceful
    language, prefixed to the most celebrated of his writings as
    "the author's account of himself."</p>

    <p>"I was always fond of visiting new scenes, and observing
    strange characters and manners. Even when a mere child I began
    my travels, and made many tours of discovery into foreign parts
    and unknown regions of my native city, to the frequent alarm of
    my parents, and the emolument of the town-crier. As I grew into
    boyhood I extended the range of my observations. My holiday
    afternoons were spent in rambles about the surrounding country.
    I made myself familiar with all its places famous in history or
    fable. I knew every spot where a murder or robbery had been
    committed, or a ghost seen. I visited the neighbouring
    villages, and added greatly to my stock of knowledge, by noting
    their habits and customs, and conversing with their sages and
    great men. I even journeyed one long summer's day to the summit
    of the most distant hill, from whence I stretched my eye over
    many a mile of terra incognita, and was astonished to find how
    vast a globe I inhabited.</p>

    <p>"This rambling propensity strengthened with my years. Books
    of voyages and travels became my passion, and in devouring
    their contents, I neglected the regular exercises of the
    school. How wistfully would I wander about the pier heads in
    fine weather, and watch the parting ships bound to distant
    climes; with what longing eyes would I gaze after their
    lessening sails; and waft myself in imagination to the ends of
    the earth.</p>

    <p>"Farther reading and thinking, though they brought this
    vague inclination into more reasonable bounds, only served to
    make it more decided. I visited various parts of my own
    country; and had I been merely influenced by a love of fine
    scenery, I should have felt little desire to seek elsewhere its
    gratification; for on no country have the charms of nature been
    more prodigally lavished. Her mighty lakes, like oceans of
    liquid silver; her mountains, with their bright aërial tints;
    her valleys, teeming with wild fertility; her tremendous
    cataracts, thundering in their solitudes; her boundless plains,
    waving with spontaneous verdure; her broad, deep rivers,
    rolling in solemn silence to the ocean; her trackless forests,
    where vegetation puts forth all its magnificence; her skies,
    kindling with the magic of summer clouds and glorious
    sunshine:&mdash;no, never need an American look beyond his own
    country for the sublime and beautiful of natural
    scenery."<a id="footnotetag2"
       name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

    <p>Mr. Irving began his career, as an author, in periodical
    literature. His first work was a humorous journal, entitled
    "Salmagundi, or the Whim-Whams and Opinions of Launcelot
    Langstaff, Esq. and Others," originally published in numbers in
    New York, where it met with a very flattering reception. The
    date of the first paper is Saturday, January 24, 1827.</p>

    <p>Salmagundi has been several times reprinted in this country;
    and it may be acceptable to know, that the cheapest, if not the
    most elegant, edition may be purchased for twenty-pence. It
    would be difficult to explain the merits of Salmagundi to the
    reader, as they are of the most varied character; but, it may
    be remarked generally, that a vein of quaint humour and human
    kindness pervades these early papers, which will bring the
    reader and writer to the best possible
    terms.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagevi"
       id="pagevi"></a>[pg vi]</span>

    <p>This lively miscellany was followed by a humorous History of
    New York, with the somewhat droll <i>nom</i> of Dedrick
    Knickerbocker as its author. It possesses considerable merit,
    with a nice perception of the ludicrous; but, on its first
    appearance, this recommendation was generally overlooked,
    whether from the local interest of the subject, or the want of
    due judgment in its readers, it is difficult to determine.</p>

    <p>About this period Mr. Irvine's name was heard in England,
    almost for the first time; his only claims to public notice
    resting entirely on Salmagundi, and the History of New York. He
    was indebted for his introduction to the acquaintance of
    European readers, to a young fellow-countryman of high
    attainments, who alludes to the above works and their author in
    the following terms:&mdash;"Mr. Irving has shown much talent
    and great humour in his Salmagundi and Knickerbocker, and they
    are exceedingly pleasant books, especially to one who
    understands the local allusions."</p>

    <p>A few years subsequent to the publication of Knickerbocker,
    Mr. Irving visited England, or the "land of wonders," as he
    facetely terms our favoured isle. During his stay, he wrote a
    series of papers, illustrative of English manners, which were
    chiefly printed in America. These papers were afterwards
    published in a collected form, in England, under the title of
    "The Sketch-Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent." and dedicated to
    Sir Walter Scott, "in testimony of the admiration and affection
    of the author." In the advertisement to the Sketch-Book, Mr.
    Irving thus modestly refers to its origin:</p>

    <p>"The author is aware of the austerity with which the
    writings of his countrymen have hitherto been treated by
    British critics: he is conscious too, that much of the contents
    of his papers can be interesting only in the eyes of American
    readers. It was not his intention, therefore, to have them
    reprinted in this country. He has, however, observed several of
    them from time to time inserted in periodical works of merit,
    and has understood that it was probable they would be
    republished in a collective form. He has been induced,
    therefore, to revise and bring them forward himself, that they
    may at least come correctly before the public. Should they be
    deemed of sufficient importance to attract the attention of
    critics, he solicits for them that courtesy and candour which a
    stranger has some right to claim, who presents himself at the
    threshold of a hospitable nation."</p>

    <p>Mr. Irving's solicitations were not made in vain, as the
    rapid sale of several editions must have convinced him; while
    every journalist in the empire hailed the work as the most
    beautiful specimen of Transatlantic talent which had been
    recognised in this country.</p>

    <p>The two volumes of the Sketch-Book appeared at different
    periods; and, at the conclusion of the second, we find the
    following apologetic postscript: "The author is conscious of
    the numerous faults and imperfections of his work; and, well
    aware how little he is disciplined and accomplished in the arts
    of authorship. His deficiencies are also increased by a
    diffidence arising from his peculiar situation. He finds
    himself writing in a strange land, and appearing before a
    public, which he has been accustomed, from childhood, to regard
    with the highest feelings of awe and reverence. He is full of
    solicitude to secure their approbation, yet finds that very
    solicitude continually embarrassing his powers, and depriving
    him of that ease and confidence which are necessary to
    successful exertion. Still the kindness with which he is
    treated encourages him to go on, hoping that, in time, he may
    acquire a steadier footing; and thus he proceeds, half
    venturing, half shrinking, surprised at his own good fortune,
    and wondering at his own temerity."</p>

    <p>The success of the Sketch-Book was followed by the almost
    equal fortune of "Bracebridge Hall, or the Humorists;" a series
    of scenes of Old English life, as displayed in one of those
    venerable halls, that rise, here and there, in a British
    landscape, as monuments of the hospitality of our ancestors,
    and better times. In the autobiographical chapter of this work,
    the writer thus pleasantly refers to his previous success, as
    "a matter of marvel, that a man, from the wilds of America,
    should express himself in tolerable English. I was looked upon
    as something <span class="pagenum"><a name="pagevii"
       id="pagevii"></a>[pg vii]</span> new and strange in
       literature,&mdash;a kind of demi-savage, with a leather in
       his hand, instead of his head; and there was a curiosity to
       hear what such a being had to say about civilized society."
       In referring the circumstances under which he writes his
       second work on English manners, he says: "Having been born
       and brought up in a new country, yet educated from infancy
       in the literature of an old one, my mind was filled with
       historical and poetical associations, connected with places,
       and manners, and customs of Europe; but which could rarely
       be applied to those of my own country. To a mind thus
       peculiarly prepared, the most ordinary objects and scenes,
       on arriving in Europe, are full of strange matter, and
       interesting novelty. England is as classic ground to an
       American, as Italy is to an Englishman; and Old London teems
       with as much historical association as mighty Rome." There
       is, also, great amiability in the concluding
       paragraph:&mdash;"I have always had an opinion, that much
       good might be done by keeping mankind in good humour with
       one another. I may be wrong in my philosophy; but I shall
       continue to practise it until convinced of its fallacy. When
       I discover the world to be all that it has been represented
       by sneering cynics and whining poets, I will turn to and
       abuse it also; in the meanwhile, worthy reader, I hope you
       will not think lightly of me, because I cannot believe this
       to be so very bad a world as it is represented."</p>

    <p>Soon after the publication of Bracebridge Hall, Mr. Irving
    left this country, where he had passed two years with literary
    and pecuniary advantage. He quitted England with a pathetic
    farewell; declaring that if, as he is accused, he views it with
    a partial eye, he shall never forget that it is his
    "fatherland." On the consanguinity of England and America too,
    and the cultivation of good feeling between them, he thus
    touchingly expresses himself in Bracebridge Hall: "We ask
    nothing from abroad that we cannot reciprocate. But with
    respect to England, we have a warm feeling of the heart, the
    glow of consanguinity that still lingers in our blood. Interest
    apart, past differences forgotten, we extend the hand of old
    relationship. We merely ask, do not estrange us from you, do
    not destroy the ancient tie of blood, do not let scoffers and
    slanderers drive a kindred nation from your side. We would fain
    be friends, do not compel us to be enemies." There is a manly
    affection in these sentiments which is truly admirable.</p>

    <p>Mr. Irving's works, with the exception of his early
    efforts,<a id="footnotetag3"
       name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>
       had been the result of his love of travel: indeed, he
       describes himself as a traveller who has "surveyed most of
       the terrestrial angles of the globe." In similar vein, he
       next produced two volumes of "Tales of a Traveller,"
       narrating legends of the continent, with masterly sketches
       of the scenery of the respective countries; the incidents of
       the Tales being fraught with points of grotesque humour, and
       abounding with pathos and poetic feeling.</p>

    <p>To these Tales succeeded a work of greater importance in
    literature than either of Mr. Irving's previous undertakings.
    We allude to a History of the Life and Voyages of Columbus, in
    four vols. 8vo., which appeared in the year 1828. Mr. Irving,
    at the time this work was first suggested to him, in the winter
    of 1825-6, was at Bordeaux; and, being informed that a
    biography was about to appear at Madrid, containing many
    important and some new documents relative to Columbus, he set
    off for the Spanish capital, to undertake the translation of
    the work. Mr. Irving, however, meeting with numerous aids at
    Madrid, resolved on producing an original history, which he has
    presented to the public with extreme diffidence: "all that I
    can safely claim," he observes, "is, an earnest desire to state
    the truth, an absence from prejudices respecting the nations
    mentioned in my history, a strong interest in my subject, and a
    zeal to make up by assiduity for many deficiencies of which I
    am conscious." This work has been abridged by Mr. Irving to one
    of the volumes of the Family Library. As we have intimated to
    the reader, it is of higher pretensions than either of the
    author's previous writings: a clever critic refers to it as "a
    spirited and interesting work, in which every thing is as
    judiciously reasoned as it is beautifully and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageviii"
       id="pageviii"></a>[pg viii]</span> forcibly expressed," and
       as "much more grave in its character and laborious in its
       execution than any of his preceding
       ones."<a id="footnotetag4"
       name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

    <p>Mr. Irving's next production was "A Chronicle of the
    Conquest of Granada," in which the author's knowledge of
    Spanish history is made to shine in detailing the chivalrous
    glories of the New World.</p>

    <p>In the spring of the present year it appears that Mr. Irving
    touched "the golden shores of old romance," and published Tales
    of the Alhambra; the origin of which work is thus told by the
    author. A few years since, Mr. Wilkie, the distinguished R.A.
    and Mr. Irving were fellow travellers on the continent. In
    their rambles about some of the old cities of Spain, they were
    struck with scenes and incidents which reminded them of
    passages in the Arabian Nights. Mr. Wilkie urged his companion
    to write something that should illustrate those peculiarities,
    "something in the Haroun Alraschid style" that should have a
    dash of that Arabian spice which pervades everything in Spain.
    Mr. Irving set about his task with enthusiasm: his study was
    the spacious Alhambra itself, and the governor gave the author
    and his companion, permission to occupy his vacant apartments
    in the Moorish palace: Mr. Wilkie soon returned to England,
    leaving Mr. Irving at the Alhambra, where he remained "for
    several months, spell-bound in the old enchanted pile." The
    result was two volumes of legends and traditions, which for
    interesting incident, and gracefulness of narrative, have few
    parallels in our romance-writing.<a id="footnotetag5"
       name="footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a>
       They are dedicated, in good taste, to the ingenious
       originator, Mr. Wilkie.</p>

    <p>In person, Mr. Irving is of middle height; and, according to
    a contemporary, of "modest deportment and easy attitude, with
    all the grace and dignity of an English
    gentleman."<a id="footnotetag6"
       name="footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a>
       Another describes him as "a most amiable man, and great
       genius, but not lively in conversation." His features have a
       pleasing regularity, and are lit up, at every corner, with
       that delightful humour which flows in a rich vein throughout
       his writings, and forms their most attractive charm.</p>

    <p>Having noticed Mr. Irving's principal works, we have left
    but little occasion to speak of his general style. A
    contemporary has denominated him the "Goldsmith of the age;"
    and of Goldsmith we must remember that, in his epitaph, Dr.
    Johnson observes: "he left no species of writing untouched, and
    adorned all to which he applied himself"&mdash;a tribute which
    can scarcely be appropriately paid to any writer of our time.
    However, we know not any author that Mr. Irving so much
    resembles as Goldsmith: although no imitator, his style and
    language forcibly remind us of that easy flow so peculiar to
    the Citizen of the World. But, we have higher warrant for this
    parallel. "It seems probable," observes a critical writer of
    considerable acumen, "that Mr. Irving might prove no
    contemptible rival to Goldsmith, whose turn of mind he very
    much inherits, and of whose style he particularly reminds us.
    Like him, too, Mr. Irving possesses the art of setting
    ludicrous perplexities in the most irresistible point of view,
    and we think equals him in the variety of
    humour."<a id="footnotetag7"
       name="footnotetag7"></a><a href="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

    <p>To conclude, we find the literary character of Mr. Irving
    illustrated in a contemporary journal, with unusual spirit.
    "There never was a writer," observes the editor, "whose
    popularity was more matter of feeling, or more intimate than
    Washington Irving, perhaps, because he appeared at once to our
    simplest and kindliest emotions. His affections were those of
    'hearth and home;' the pictures he delighted to draw were those
    of natural loveliness, linked with human sympathies; and a too
    unusual thing with the writers of our time&mdash;he looked upon
    God's works, and 'saw that they were good.' * * * With him the
    wine of life is not always on the lees. An exquisite vein of
    poetry runs through every page,&mdash;and of poetry, his
    epithets who does not remember&mdash;'the shark, glancing like
    a spectre through the blue seas.'"<a id="footnotetag8"

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
